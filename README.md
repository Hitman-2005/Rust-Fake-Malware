# Fake Malware Rust Version
Pros:

- Can do register and login function
- After login it will encrypt

Cons:

- Cannot decrypt the file itself
- Need to copy and paste the decrypt text to the encrpytion file and replace the encrypt text

Sorry I upload the Source Code as Zip File due to files more than 100 and github can't upload more than 100 files.
There is a file.txt in files directory inside the source code folder, that file.txt is the encrypt and decrypt target for this project
You can try writing any text to that file and try encrypt and decrypt.
